Cal Evans was born in Mobile, Alabama, and spent his early years adventuring across the Southeast United States, a nomadic childhood that instilled in him a lifelong love of exploration and discovery.

Many moons ago, at the tender age of 14, he touched his first computer—a TRS-80 Model 1 (using the term "computer" loosely)—and from that moment, his curiosity for how things work was sparked forever. He progressed through Commodores and IBM PCs, always tinkering, learning, and finding joy in unraveling mysteries, whether mechanical or digital.

Now settled in sunny Florida, Cal is happily married to wife 1.42, the lovely and talented Kathy, his steadfast partner since their wedding. Together they raised two wonderful grown children, both clever enough to forge their own unique paths, along with a clever four-legged family member who often steals the show.

When not reminiscing about past adventures or planning the next, Cal channels his storytelling heart into writing, including Autobiographical Fiction, a deeply personal, although largly imagined collection of tales woven from the threads of his life, dedicated with love to his mother.
